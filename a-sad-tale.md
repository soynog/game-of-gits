House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.


Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to being, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!  Then his younger brother will be come king.  However, he really wont have any power as his mother will run the show.

Also there was a birthday party with lots of delicious pie.

I love pie, what kind of pie will be at the party.
